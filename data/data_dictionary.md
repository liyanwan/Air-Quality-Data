## WSEI Formula and Design Decisions

The Wildfire Smoke Exposure Index aggregates hotspot-level fire activity into a
station-day covariate that accounts for distance decay, wind transport, and
multi-day persistence:

```
WSEI(s, t, k) = Σ_f  log(1 + I_f) × K(d(s,f)) × W(Δθ_{s,f}, v_{s,t-k})
```

where `f` indexes hotspots on day `t − k`, and `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.

---

### Distance Kernel: Cauchy — `K(d) = 1 / (1 + (d / 500 km)²)`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| At d = 0 km | K = 1.0 |
| At d = 500 km | K = 0.5 |
| At d = 1,000 km | K = 0.2 |
| At d = 2,000 km | K = 0.05 (hard cutoff applied here) |

**Pros:**
- Smooth, continuous — no artificial discontinuity at any distance
- Well-behaved at d = 0 (unlike pure inverse-distance which diverges)
- One interpretable parameter: d₀ = half-weight distance (500 km)
- Power-law tail allows occasional long-range smoke plumes to contribute

**Cons:**
- d₀ = 500 km is a modelling assumption; run sensitivity at 250 km and 1,000 km
- Never reaches exactly zero (residual contribution from very distant fires;
  mitigated by the 2,000 km hard cutoff)
- Heavier tail than Gaussian — may over-weight large but distant fire complexes

**Alternatives considered:**
- Gaussian `exp(−d²/2σ²)`: faster dropoff, but needs two tuning decisions (σ
  and a separate hard cutoff)
- Exponential `exp(−d/λ)`: lighter tail than Cauchy, similar to atmospheric
  dispersion but less evidence for this specific choice

### Wind Alignment: `W(Δθ, v) = v × max(0, cos(Δθ))`

Δθ = (bearing from station to hotspot) − (station wind-from direction)

The hotspot is **upwind** of the station when Δθ ≈ 0° (wind blows directly from
hotspot toward station). The cosine weighting gives full weight at 0°, half-weight
at 60°, and zero weight at ±90° (perpendicular or headwind directions).

| Scenario | Δθ | cos(Δθ) | Interpretation |
|----------|----|---------|----------------|
| Hotspot directly upwind | 0° | 1.0 | Full weight |
| 45° off-axis | 45° | 0.71 | Reduced weight |
| Perpendicular | 90° | 0.0 | No contribution |
| Downwind of station | 180° | −1.0 → clamped 0 | No contribution |

Scales linearly with wind speed `v` (km/h): stronger wind → more efficient transport.

**Special cases:**
- `wind_dir_deg = NaN` or 0 (calm): directional alignment set to 0.5 (neutral)
- `wind_spd_kmh = NaN`: replaced with 1.0 (no speed scaling)

**Pros:**
- Physically intuitive and easy to explain to stakeholders
- Zero contribution from headwind or crosswind hotspots — reduces noise
- No additional bandwidth parameters

**Cons:**
- Cosine function has a broad acceptance angle (±90°); Gaussian alignment would
  be more selective
- Uses station wind direction as a proxy for the transport path, which is a
  simplification (smoke transport is governed by the full wind field aloft)
- Single-day wind at the station — does not account for multi-day trajectory

**Alternative considered:** Gaussian alignment `exp(−Δθ²/2σ_θ²)` with σ_θ ≈ 30°
gives sharper directional focus but adds a tuning parameter.

### Lag Structure: k = 0, 1, 2, 3 days

Smoke from distant fires takes time to reach monitoring stations. Lags up to 3
days capture both same-day local fires and transported smoke from regional events.
Beyond 3 days, fire activity correlation with local AQI diminishes substantially.

---

### Distance Cutoff: 2,000 km

Hotspots beyond 2,000 km contribute K < 0.05 under the Cauchy kernel. Applying
this hard cutoff reduces per-iteration computation by > 80% with negligible loss
of signal. North American wildfire smoke plumes that travel > 2,000 km are rare
and typically diluted below AQI-measurable thresholds.
